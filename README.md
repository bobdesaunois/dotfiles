# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles

I like KooL's Hyprland Rice, which you can find [right here.](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots/wiki/Install_&_Update#cloning-the-dotfiles-and-using-copysh-to-install-the-hyprland-config)

For Helix I don't really have any configs, it's awesome right out of the box.
